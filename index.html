    <h1>Jovana Escobar </h1>
    <br>
    <br>

<p>My name is Jovana Escobar and I am horrible at talking about myself, but I will do my best to do so! Some of my favorite things to do are the simple things in life. I am a bed head. I can lay in bed for hours catching up on my shows, or more than likely watching old reruns of things ive watched plenty of times before but I still enjoy watching anyways.Uber Eats is the best! Nothing beats take out in bed delivered directly to your home.</p>
<p> I am also a walking contradiction. As much as i may love lounging, I also love to explore. When I can manage to pull myself out of the house, I tend to wander off into the city on my own. I love walking around (get that cardio in), taking in the scenery, and also exploring different restaurants, bars, or stores that come along my way.</p>
