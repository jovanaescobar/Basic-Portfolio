                <img class="profile" src="https://placehold.it/200x200" alt="AGB photo 404">I am a young professional entering the world of Full-Stack Development. Prior to starting this new endeavor, I was a student at Montclair State University pursuing a major in Communication & Media Studies with a minor in English.<br>
                <br>
                Shortly after receiving my bachelors degree, I started working full-time in the constantly evolving indursty of ride sharing. After spending some time in the indurstry and loving the constantly evolving fast paced world the tech indursty has to offer, along with a lot of researching and soul searching, I became very interested in learning more about what being behind the scenes as a Full-Stack Web Developer had to offer.
