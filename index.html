 <p style="color:gray">I am horrible at talking about myself, but I will do my best to do so! Some of my favorite things to do are the simple things in life. I cannot tell a lie, I am a bed head. I can lay in bed for hours catching up on my shows, or more than likely watching old reruns of things I have already watched plenty of times before but yet I still enjoy watching 5x's in. While doing this, Uber Eats is the best! Nothing beats take out in bed delivered directly to your home. I am also a walking contradiction. As much as I may love lounging, I also love to explore. When I can manage to pull myself out of the house, I tend to wander off into the city on my own. I love walking around (you know... get that cardio in), and exploring different restaurants, bars, or stores that come along my way. As you can see, food is included at all times. </p>
